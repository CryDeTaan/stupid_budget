# Stupid Budget

No one likes setting up a Budget and never mind maintaining it. But it has to be done.

Budgeting is stupid.

So lets use K.I.S.S - Let's keep it simple, stupid. (K-I-S-S, was developed and used as a design principle by the US Navy in the 60s)

### Budget

The (Stupid) Budget helps you to visually see your budget and spending with progress bars.
